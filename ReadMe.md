# How to use
1) If you find a topic under the `Awaiting Implementation` which havent seen any work yet , you can contribute for that.
2) `Expected Improvement` are mechanics that have already been implemented but seek perfection.
3) <a href = "https://discord.gg/MN6ccBjJK9"> Discord Server</a>.

# Expected Improvement
1) Viewport Rotation Using Mouse (movement implemented but is buggy)
2) Simple Physics Implementation (simple collision)
*Apply transform to intersected triangles. Current calculations are only based on initial vertex positions.

# Please do this for me 
1) Normals in Materials
 
# Awaiting Implementation
1) Local Camera Movement and Rotation
2) Component System
